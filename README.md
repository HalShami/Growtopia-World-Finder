# Growtopia-World-Finder
This program is **designed to search for worlds in the game Growtopia**. You can specify the length of the world name, and the number of iterations (worlds to search) you want to perform. 
Depending on which version of the code you run, each iteration can take from 5-15 seconds. 
The purpose is to **find worlds that are not locked** with short names as they are highly valued.
The **first version is a CLI version**, the **second version incorporates a GUI** designed with TKinter. 
Keep in mind that there are **2 scripts**, one designed for **1080p** screen users and another for **1440P** users. Also, you **must run Growtopia in full screen mode**.
The Initial Versions rely on the user to monitor the program and look for the empty worlds as it runs through random worlds automatically.
Later versions utilize Neural Networks such as **CNN's and Optical Character Recognition Algorithms to detect worlds that are not locked/taken and save the worlds' names to a .txt file** which can later be accessed by the user.
The program is still in early stages so expect bugs; however, if you would like to contribute to this project or have any feedback feel free to do so.
